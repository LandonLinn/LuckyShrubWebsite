## About the Project

In this project, I built the homepage for Lucky Shrubs, a fictional website focused on showcasing various shrubs and plants. The goal was to design a simple, yet visually appealing page that effectively organizes content using CSS Grid. I used grid-area to position elements, ensuring that the layout remains responsive and user-friendly across different screen sizes. The project helped me strengthen my front-end development skills, particularly in CSS Grid and responsive design.
